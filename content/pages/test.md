About Sahaja Yoga
-----------------

Sahaja Yoga Meditation was developed by [Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi](https://jay1roy.wixsite.com/free-meditation/founder). It involves awakening a subtle spiritual energy known as the Kundalini, which lies dormant in the sacrum bone at the base of the spine in three-and-a-half coils. The gentle awakening of this Kundalini energy and the inner journey of self-discovery is known as Enlightenment (Self-realisation).  
  
Sahaja means 'spontaneous' or 'born with you' and Yoga translates to 'union' (with the Divine or all-pervading power). Sahaja Yoga Meditation then translates to 'the method of divine union through yoga which everyone is born with'. Sahaja Yoga Meditation is for anyone who desires to find his or her true self, which is full of joy, peace, and love. It is not just a book or a set of exercises but a living science that will open up to you gradually as your meditation becomes more profound and your experience stronger and more fulfilling.   
  
Sahaja Yoga Meditation classes are held in over 100 countries worldwide and are always provided free of charge. Right from the early days, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi made it clear that this knowledge and the process of union effected by our Self-realisation is the birthright of every human being and therefore cannot be charged for.  
  
Sahaja Meditation is an official partner of the UNESCO Centre for Peace.

What is Meditation?
===================

Humans are facing unprecedented levels of stress and fatigue today and meditation can be a great way to unwind and get some sense of balance in life. There are however, many different forms of meditation practiced around the world. Sahaja Yoga meditation is about bringing our attention inside and  awakening the primordial energy that lays dormant within. Meditation is a state where we are not thinking  or imagining but our attention is on our [Subtle System](https://jay1roy.wixsite.com/free-meditation/subtle-system). It is not something we do, but a state we reach, known as the Thoughtless Awareness, ("Turya" or "Nirvichaar Samaadhi" in Sanskrit). We de-condition ourselves and move away from the reliance on the mind to another subtle, more powerful aspect of our own good self, the primordial mother energy, Kundalini. When we meditate, we try to get to this state (thoughtless awareness). 

Meditating 10 to 15 minutes daily nourishes and improves the individual’s connection with their true spirit – the source of all peace and joy. There can be immediate benefits with the levels of stress & contentment. It has been scientifically shown that regular Sahaja Yoga meditation can cure ailments, attain balance, and enlightenment.
